# stopRecording
Sends a "Stop Recording" command to OBS version 28
All of this was built using the infomration at https://github.com/obs-websocket-community-projects/obs-websocket-java

OBS version 27 switched to using a different API protocol, and I had to recreate the stopRecording program to interface with the new API.

I also ended up using Maven for the first time on a pesonal project.
